# markdown_cheatsheet
I made this cheatsheet as someone who has just learned how to write Markdown. 
My main source for learning Markdown is linked in the cheatsheet. I wanted to
have a quick list that references the syntax I am finding myself use every day.

My Markdown Cheatsheet has also served as practice for writing a technical document.
If you have any feedback for me I would appreciate it! Thanks for looking and I 
hope this cheatsheet can help you too.
